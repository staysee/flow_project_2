#Flow Finder

##Hoop dance. Poi. Staff. Fire Fans. Fire dance

###About

Flow Finder was built to create a space for flow artists (and those interested in flow arts) where they can search for any workshops, classes, jams, or festivals happening in their area. The flow arts is relatively new so there aren't many areas with a large flow community. A person would have to specifically search the internet for classes in hoop, poi, fans, staff, etc. and find a lack of classes.

On Flow Finder, a user will be able to post any event they are hosting so other users can search by prop, location, or type of event. They will also be able to make a post onto their Profile Page with text, images, and add tags. All users' posts can be viewed from the feed to see what's going on with Flow Artists all over the world!

####Current Problems I'm Working On

####Ideas for future additions:
- A lot of styling...
- Search by user, event, location,etc.
- Sort function
- Post video/short clip
