#Flow Finder

##::move it to the rhythm - groove with the flow:: 
Hoop. Poi. Staff. Fire Fans

###About
Flow Finder was built to create a space for flow artists (and those interested in flow arts) where they can search for workshops, classes, jams, or festivals happening in their area. Flow Arts is relatively new so there aren't many areas with a large flow community. A person would have to search the internet for classes specifically in hoop, poi, fans, staff, etc. Many areas may not even offer these types of classes.

On Flow Finder, a user will be able to share an event they are hosting by posting to the Events page. Users can search by prop, location, or type of event. Each user has their own profile page where they can create posts and add tags (for searching other posts with the same tag). Users can look through all posts in a gallery to see what's going on with flow artists all over the world!
